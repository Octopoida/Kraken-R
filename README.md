# Kraken-R

## Purpose 
Kraken-R is a monolithic R script for learning R.
The script style is as a cheatsheet of sorts to help remember how to do
certain things, and strives to provide better examples than what is
available in R help or vignettes.
Single file to keep it simple,
even though using Project Template & LCFD file model as project workflows is a good idea.
