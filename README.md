# Kraken-R

## Purpose 
Purpose: Kraken-R is a monolithic R script for learning R.
The script style is as a cheatsheet of sorts to help remember how to do
certain things, and strives to provide better examples than what is
available in R help or vignettes.
Single file to keep it simple,
even though using Project Template & LCFD file model as project workflows is a good idea.
LCFD project workflow by Josh Reich
LCFD: Load, Clean, Function, Do --each as a seperate script.
