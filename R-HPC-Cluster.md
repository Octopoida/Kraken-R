# Setting Up HPC with Windows Server 2025 for Distributed R Computing

Setting up a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment with Windows Server 2025 to run R in a distributed cluster involves several steps, including installing the necessary software, configuring the cluster, and integrating R with an MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed computing. Since Windows Server 2025 is a relatively new release (and as of February 26, 2025, it’s likely in preview or recently released), this guide is based on established patterns from Microsoft HPC Pack with prior Windows Server versions, adapted for what’s plausible with 2025. Microsoft HPC Pack is the go-to solution for HPC on Windows, and it’s reasonable to assume it will support Windows Server 2025, potentially with an updated version like HPC Pack 2022 or 2025.

Below is a step-by-step guide, followed by details on the MPI used.

## Step 1: Install Windows Server 2025 and HPC Pack

1. **Install Windows Server 2025**:
   - Deploy Windows Server 2025 on your head node (the machine that will manage the cluster) and compute nodes (the machines that will perform the computations).
   - Ensure all nodes are joined to an Active Directory domain for seamless management and security.
   - Apply all critical updates via Windows Update.

2. **Install Microsoft HPC Pack**:
   - Download the latest version of Microsoft HPC Pack compatible with Windows Server 2025 from the Microsoft website. As of now, HPC Pack 2019 is the latest stable release, but check for a 2022 or 2025 update by February 2025.
   - On the head node, run the HPC Pack installer (e.g., `Setup.exe`). Choose "Create a new HPC cluster by creating a head node" during installation.
   - Follow the wizard, ensuring the HPC databases (e.g., scheduling, management) are hosted locally on the head node (default for smaller clusters) or on a separate SQL Server instance if scaling to hundreds of nodes.
   - Install HPC Pack on compute nodes by selecting "Join an existing HPC cluster" and pointing them to the head node.

3. **Configure the Cluster**:
   - Open **HPC Cluster Manager** on the head node.
   - Add compute nodes via the "Node Management" section. Ensure network connectivity (e.g., TCP port 443) and that nodes are online.
   - Set up a private network for MPI communication if low-latency is needed (optional, requires additional hardware like RDMA-capable adapters).

## Step 2: Install R on All Nodes

1. **Install R**:
   - Download the latest version of R from CRAN (e.g., R 4.4.x as of early 2025) and install it on the head node and all compute nodes. Use the same version across all nodes to avoid compatibility issues.
   - Install R to a consistent path (e.g., `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.4.x`).

2. **Install Required R Packages**:
   - On the head node, launch R and install the `Rmpi` package, which enables R to use MPI for parallel computing:
     ```R
     install.packages("Rmpi", configure.args = "--with-Rmpi-type=MSMPI")
     ```
   - Install additional parallel packages like `snow` or `parallel`:
     ```R
     install.packages(c("snow", "doParallel", "foreach"))
     ```
   - Copy the R library folder (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourUser>\Documents\R\win-library\4.4`) to all compute nodes to ensure consistency.

## Step 3: Configure MPI for R

1. **MPI in Use: Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI)**:
   - Microsoft HPC Pack includes **MS-MPI** as its default MPI implementation. MS-MPI is a Windows-optimized version based on MPICH2, and it’s tightly integrated with HPC Pack for running parallel jobs. As of HPC Pack 2019 (and likely its successors), MS-MPI is the standard, and no additional MPI installation is needed unless you opt for a third-party alternative (e.g., Intel MPI).
   - Verify MS-MPI is installed by running `mpiexec -version` in a command prompt on the head node. It should report a version like "Microsoft MPI 10.x".

2. **Set Up MS-MPI Environment**:
   - Ensure the MS-MPI binaries (e.g., `mpiexec.exe`, `smpd.exe`) are in the system PATH. HPC Pack typically adds these automatically (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Microsoft MPI\Bin`).
   - Test MPI connectivity across nodes:
     ```
     mpiexec -hosts 2 <node1> 1 <node2> 1 hostname
     ```
     Replace `<node1>` and `<node2>` with your compute node names. This should return the hostnames of both nodes if MS-MPI is working.

3. **Link R with MS-MPI**:
   - The `Rmpi` package on Windows defaults to using MS-MPI when installed with HPC Pack. Confirm this by checking the output of:
     ```R
     library(Rmpi)
     mpi.universe.size()
     ```
     This should return the total number of MPI processes available (e.g., number of cores across nodes).

---

## Step 4: Run R in a Distributed Cluster

1. **Create an R Script for Distributed Execution**:
   - Example script (`distribute.R`):
     ```R
     library(Rmpi)
     mpi.spawn.Rslaves()  # Spawns R workers across the cluster
     cat("Number of slaves:", mpi.comm.size() - 1, "\n")
     mpi.remote.exec(paste("Hello from rank", mpi.comm.rank()))
     mpi.close.Rslaves()
     mpi.quit()
     ```

2. **Submit the Job via HPC Job Manager**:
   - Open **HPC Job Manager** on the head node.
   - Create a new job:
     - **Task Type**: Basic Task
     - **Command**: `Rscript --vanilla C:\path\to\distribute.R`
     - **Resources**: Specify the number of nodes/cores (e.g., 2 nodes, 32 cores each).
     - Submit the job and monitor output in the "Job Output" tab.

3. **Alternative: Run Directly with mpiexec**:
   - From a command prompt on the head node:
     ```
     mpiexec -n 64 -hosts 2 <node1> 32 <node2> 32 "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.4.x\bin\Rscript.exe" C:\path\to\distribute.R
     ```
     This runs the script across 64 processes (32 per node).

## Step 5: Validate and Optimize

- **Validate**:
  - Check job logs in HPC Cluster Manager or console output to ensure all nodes are participating.
  - Use `mpi.comm.rank()` in R to confirm each process is running on a different node/core.

- **Optimize**:
  - If performance is critical, configure a high-speed network (e.g., RDMA) and tweak MS-MPI settings via environment variables (e.g., `MPICH_NETMASK` for network selection).
  - Adjust R’s memory usage with `memory.limit()` if needed.

---

## Which MPI is Used?

In this scenario, **Microsoft MPI (MS-MPI)** is the MPI implementation. It’s bundled with HPC Pack, optimized for Windows, and seamlessly integrates with R via the `Rmpi` package. MS-MPI supports the MPI-2 standard with extensions for Windows-specific features like Event Tracing and is the recommended choice for Windows HPC clusters due to its native support and stability. While alternatives like MPICH or OpenMPI can be installed manually, they’re less common on Windows and require additional configuration, making MS-MPI the practical default here.

## Final Notes

This setup should get you running R in a distributed cluster on Windows Server 2025 with HPC Pack. If you encounter issues (e.g., job hangs), double-check network connectivity, firewall settings (allow MS-MPI ports like 8677), and that R and `Rmpi` are identically configured across nodes. For further assistance, feel free to troubleshoot with additional details!
