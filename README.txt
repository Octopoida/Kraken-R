# Purpose ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: Kraken-R is a monolithic R script for learning R.
# The script style is as a cheatsheet of sorts to help remember how to do
# certain things, and strives to provide better examples than what is
# available in R help or vignettes.
# It uses The Evergreen State College,
# Computer Applications Lab (CAL) for Scientific Computing,
# HeadCount to learn R, as well as some other datasets.
# Single file to keep it simple,
# even though using Project Template & LCFD file model as project workflows is a good idea.
# LCFD project workflow by Josh Reich
# LCFD: Load, Clean, Function, Do --each as a seperate script.
